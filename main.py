# Task 1: Upload the Papers
# So that GPT knows about the latest AGI research, we will provide it with some arxiv papers. There are 10 recent papers on AGI stored in the papers directory of this workbook.
#
# Click File -> Show workbook files to see a file browser.
# The papers were found by searching arxiv for "AGI", then eyballing recent papers for content on definitions of AGI or progress towards AGI.
#
# The table below shows the filenames and the titles of the papers.
